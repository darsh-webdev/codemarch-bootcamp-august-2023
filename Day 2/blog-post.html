    <h1 style="color: darkblue">The End of Front-End Development?</h1>
    <p>
      Over the past few months, I've spoken with lots of early-career devs who
      are getting more and more anxious about <strong>AI</strong>. They've seen
      the increasingly-impressive demos from tools like GPT-4, and they worry
      that by the time they're fluent in HTML/CSS/JS, there won't be any jobs
      left for them.

      <strong>I couldn't disagree more</strong>. I don't think web developer
      jobs are going anywhere. And I'm getting pretty sick of the
      <abbr title="Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt">FUD</abbr> being spread online.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in this blog post, I'm going to share my hypothesis for what will
      happen. Things <em>are</em> going to change, but not in the scary way
      people are saying.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: darkblue">Looking into the future</h2>
    <p>
      There is an enormous difference between generating a 50-line HTML document
      and spitting out a production-ready web application. A JS app like a blog
      site has <del>~10k</del> ~65k lines of code, across 900+ files. That
      doesn't include the written content, only the JavaScript and
      TypeScript.<br /><br />
      Even with 95<sup>%</sup> accuracy rate, this would be incredibly difficult
      to debug. It would be like a developer spending months building a huge
      project, without ever actually trying to run any of the code, until it was
      100<sup>%</sup> finished. This is the stuff of nightmares.<br /><br />
      AI isn't <em>magic</em>. It's only as good as its training data. Code
      snippets are all over the internet, and are often generic. By contrast,
      every codebase is unique. There are very few large open-source codebases.
      How's the AI supposed to learn how to build big real-world projects?<br /><br />
      We're very quickly reaching the point where non-developers can sit down
      with a chatbot and crank out a small self-contained project, the sort of
      thing that folks currently use tools like Webflow to build. And that's
      awesome!<br /><br />
      But I think we're still a <strong><em>very long way</em></strong> from
      major tech companies letting go of their developer staff and replacing
      them with prompt engineers. It seems to me like there are several
      potentially-unsolveable problems that stand in the way of this becoming a
      reality.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: darkblue">Augmenting, not replacing!</h2>
    <p>
      I think the most likely scenario is that tools like GPT-4 become
      integrated into developer tooling, and used to amplify what a skilled
      developer can do.<br /><br />
      Carpenters weren't replaced by power tools, accountants weren't replaced
      by spreadsheets, photographers weren't replaced by digital cameras /
      smartphones*, and I don't think that developers will be replaced by
      <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr>.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: darkblue">A message to aspiring developers</h2>
    <p>
      The reason I wanted to write this blog post was specifically to address
      folks who are in the <em>process of learning web development</em> and who
      are feeling anxious and despondent.I can't promise that things will stay
      exactly the same. I do suspect that AI will have an impact on how we work.
    </p>

      It's just that I don't want you to look back in 5 years, if software
      developers are
      <em
        >even more in-demand, and regret that you stopped pursuing your
        dreams</em
      >. ❤️
