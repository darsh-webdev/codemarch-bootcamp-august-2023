            <h2>Cultivating a Reading Habit</h2>
            <p><em>Posted on August 7, 2023 by Darshan Rajput</em></p>
            <img src="https://mypenmyfriend.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/784784p888EDNmain745iStock_68342469_XLARGE.jpg" width="300">
            <p>Since the start of this year, I decided to develop healthy habits in myself and I choose <strong>Reading</strong> as one of them! In this post, I'd like to share some highlights and tips on how you can develop a reading habit too.</p>
            <p>Since I've started, reading has transformed my life in an insane number of ways, and I couldn’t be more thankful that it’s a thing I’ve made a habit of doing. It has helped me to reduce stress, improve my focus and concentration, get better sleep and considerably increase my vocabulary.</p>
            <p>Here are 5 tips for how you can develop a reading habit at home:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Make a List</strong>: Keep a list of all the great books to want to read.</li>
                <li><strong>Make it pleasureable</strong>: Read books that you highly enjoy or it will feel like a chore.</li>
                <li><strong>Set times</strong>: Have a few set times throughout the day when you'll read for atleast 5-10 minutes. If you even start with 3 times a day you'll read for 30 minutes a day.</li>
                <li><strong>Find a quite place</strong>: find a place at your home where you can sit comfortably and with any interruptions. </li>
                <li><strong>Set a goal</strong>: For example, you could set a goal to read a certain number of books this year or a certain number of pages each day and then work on reaching that goal. This will motivate you to read more.</li>
            </ul>
